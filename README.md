toycc
=====

A C compiler front-end (using LLVM as the back-end) written in C++.

Currently in a state where it works only a very limited number of programs 
written in C. An example program that works (on OS X 10.9) can be found at 
test/ir.c; which should show most what can currently be used in toycc.
